### Below is a map of the beautiful National Parks I have visited.

```{r prelims, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("leaflet")
library("tidyverse")
```


```{r da_map, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
visited <- read_csv("data/NP_visited.csv", col_names = TRUE)

Parks_visited_map <- visited %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(popup = visited$popup)
Parks_visited_map
```

The `GitHub` repository, which contains the raw data and code necessary to reproduce this map, are located [here](https://github.com/butterflyology/National_Parks).
